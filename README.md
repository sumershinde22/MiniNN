# Neural Network Simulation Project

## Overview

This project is designed to simulate and experiment with basic neural network concepts using Python. It includes three main components:

- Neuron.py: This module handles the creation and management of neurons, the basic building blocks of neural networks. It defines the neuron's properties and their response behavior.
- GradientDescent.py: Implements the gradient descent algorithm, which is crucial for optimizing the neural network's weight adjustment during training, aiming to minimize the loss function.
- engine.py: Serves as the core engine that integrates the neuron functionalities and gradient descent optimization to simulate a simple neural network.
## Purpose

The aim of this project is to provide a hands-on approach to understanding how neural networks operate at a fundamental level. It is particularly useful for educational purposes, allowing users to visualize and modify the behavior of neural networks.

## Key Features

- Simulation of Neuron Dynamics: Explore how individual neurons respond to inputs and how they can be linked together.
- Optimization with Gradient Descent: Learn about the optimization process in training neural networks through a hands-on implementation of the gradient descent algorithm.
- Integration and Testing: Utilize the engine to combine various components, test different configurations, and observe the outcomes in a controlled environment.
